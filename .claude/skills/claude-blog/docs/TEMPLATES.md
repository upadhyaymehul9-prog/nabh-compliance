## How Templates Work

Templates are structural blueprints, not fill-in-the-blank forms. Each template
defines:

1. **Section structure**: The H2/H3 skeleton for the content type
2. **Answer-first prompts**: Guidance for opening each section with data
3. **Word count targets**: Per-section and total word counts
4. **Info gain markers**: Where original data or unique perspective is needed
5. **Visual element placement**: Where charts and images should appear
6. **FAQ zone**: Where the FAQ section fits in the flow
7. **Linking zones**: Where internal and external links are most natural

## Template Structure Anatomy

Every template follows a consistent internal structure:

```

## How /blog write Selects Templates

When `/blog write` is invoked, the orchestrator selects a template based on:

### 1. Explicit User Request

If the user specifies a content type, that template is used directly:

```
/blog write "10 Best CI/CD Tools for 2026"      --> listicle.md
/blog write "How to Set Up Kubernetes Monitoring" --> how-to.md
/blog write case study: Acme Corp migration       --> case-study.md
```

### 2. Topic Analysis

If no type is specified, the orchestrator analyzes the topic:

| Topic Signal | Template Selected |
|-------------|-------------------|
| "How to...", "Guide to..." | how-to.md |
| Numbers in title ("10 Best...", "7 Ways...") | listicle.md |
| "X vs Y", "compared", "alternative" | comparison.md |
| "Review", "tested", "hands-on" | product-review.md |
| Company/project name + "results" | case-study.md |
| Broad topic, "complete guide", "everything" | pillar-page.md |
| "Tutorial", "walkthrough", "step by step" | tutorial.md |
| News event, update, announcement | news-analysis.md |
| Survey, study, data, research | data-research.md |
| "FAQ", "questions about" | faq-knowledge-base.md |
| Industry trend, prediction, opinion | thought-leadership.md |
| Expert quotes, collection, roundup | roundup.md |

### 3. Default

If the topic is ambiguous, the orchestrator defaults to `how-to.md` as the
most versatile template and confirms with the user.

## How to Customize Templates

### Modifying an Existing Template

1. Navigate to `~/.claude/skills/blog/templates/`
2. Open the template file you want to modify
3. Adjust section structure, word counts, or guidance
4. Changes take effect immediately (no restart needed)

### Creating a New Template

1. Copy an existing template as a starting point:
   ```bash
   cp ~/.claude/skills/blog/templates/how-to.md \
      ~/.claude/skills/blog/templates/my-custom-type.md
   ```
2. Define the section structure for your content type
3. Add `ANSWER-FIRST:`, `VISUAL:`, and `INFO-GAIN:` markers
4. Set appropriate word count targets
5. Add a topic signal entry in the template selection logic

### Template Best Practices

- Keep sections focused on one topic each
- Place `VISUAL:` markers where data naturally supports a chart
- Use `INFO-GAIN:` markers liberally: these are the sections that
  differentiate your content from AI-generated consensus
- Set realistic word counts that match the content type's natural depth
- Ensure every template includes an FAQ zone and conclusion

## Template and Scoring Integration

Templates guide content creation; the scoring system validates the result.
The mapping between template features and scoring categories:

| Template Feature | Scoring Category | Points At Stake |
|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Section structure | Schema & Structure | 10 |
| Answer-first markers | Answer-First Formatting | 20 |
| Visual placement | Visual Elements | 15 |
| FAQ zone | Schema & Structure | 4 |
| Info-gain markers | Content Quality | 25 |
| Citation guidance | Statistics & Citations | 20 |

A well-followed template naturally produces content scoring 75+ without
additional optimization passes.
